# Streamflow Monitor

## Overview

**Streamflow Monitor** is a web application designed for the monitoring and
visualization of streamflow data across various gauge stations within the United
States, with a specific focus on the state of Missouri. The application displays
data from 274 gauge stations, providing insights into the streamflow and gauge
height measurements.

Streamflow, defined as the volume of water flowing through a given section of a
stream per unit time, along with gauge height, which is the height of water at a
particular point, are critical parameters for water resource management. These
measurements are essential for determining water availability, monitoring
watershed health, and predicting flood risks.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) operates numerous stream gauges
across the country, collecting data on these parameters. The **Streamflow
Monitor** web app accesses this valuable data using the USGS Water Services API.

## Importance of Streamflow Measurements

Measurements of streamflow are crucial for:

- **Water Resource Management**: Understanding the availability and distribution
  of water resources in a given area.
- **Flood Predictions**: Providing data necessary for forecasting flood events
  and preparing mitigation strategies.
- **Environmental Protection**: Monitoring the health of ecosystems that depend
  on streamflow patterns.

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive maps and graphs that display real-time
  streamflow and gauge height data.
- **Gauge Station Selection**: Users can select specific gauge stations to view
  detailed data and historical trends.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring
  access to data anytime, anywhere.

## Data Source

The application utilizes data from the USGS Water Services API, which offers
comprehensive and up-to-date information on streamflow conditions across the
United States.
